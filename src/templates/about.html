    <p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in building complex, performant user interfaces. My expertise includes:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Frontend Architecture</strong> — Designing scalable state management, API layers, and module structures</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> — Bundle analysis, code splitting, rendering performance</li>
      <li><strong>Testing</strong> — Unit, integration, and E2E testing strategies</li>
      <li><strong>Team Leadership</strong> — Mentoring developers, code reviews, establishing best practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Experience Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Led frontend architecture for applications serving 1M+ users</li>
      <li>Reduced bundle sizes by 60% through strategic code splitting</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
    <p>
      After years of working with React, Next.js, and various abstractions, I wanted
      to reconnect with the fundamentals. This portfolio is intentionally built with
      zero frameworks — just TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a reminder that
      understanding the platform matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Tech I Work With</h2>
    <p>
      React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, GraphQL, REST APIs, Vite, Webpack,
      Jest, Playwright, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, Git, CI/CD pipelines.
